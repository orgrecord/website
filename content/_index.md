_**Writing the history of baseball, in datasets**_

We are a group of historians and data scientists compiling the data
history of baseball.

We capture and curate information from
sources spanning the history of the game, from the Major Leagues to
collegiate and strong amateur play.  

We write data profiles of 
the players, managers, umpires and administrators of the game, using
biographical, performance, and administrative data to construct a
timeline of their lives in and outside of baseball.  

We aim to do for all of baseball, what ICI and the first Baseball
Encyclopedia did for the historical record of the Major Leagues.

We are the **Organization of Record**.
